    <h1>The Magenta Monster</h1>
    <h3>This creature may appear friendly, however, the Magenta Monster is one of the most feared animals in the world. </h3>
    <h3> Its tactic to lure you in starts with the eyes. As it blinks, the eyes become larger, creating a hipnotizing feeling in the victim.</h3> 
    <h3> Be careful...becuase if you look in the eyes when the sun sets, you'll be under the spell forever.</h3>
